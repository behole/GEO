# Agent 4: Monitoring & Alerting Agent - Technical Specification

## Agent Overview
The Monitoring & Alerting Agent provides continuous tracking of GEO performance improvements, competitive changes, and optimization opportunities through automated monitoring and intelligent alerting systems.

## Core Architecture

### Integration with All Previous Agents
```python
# Comprehensive data integration
baseline_metrics = load_agent1_results()      # Initial performance benchmarks
content_scores = load_agent2_results()        # Content optimization tracking
competitive_intel = load_agent3_results()     # Market position monitoring
optimization_timeline = track_changes()       # Implementation progress
```

### Primary Functions

#### 1. Performance Monitoring
- **Citation Frequency Tracking**: Daily monitoring of AI engine mentions
- **Score Progression Monitoring**: Track Discovery, Context, and Competitive scores
- **Content Performance Analytics**: Monitor implemented content optimizations
- **Competitive Position Alerts**: Track market share changes vs competitors

#### 2. Intelligent Alerting System
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Significant performance changes (±15%)
- **Competitive Movement Alerts**: When competitors gain/lose significant ground
- **Opportunity Alerts**: New content gaps or emerging query trends
- **Implementation Reminders**: Follow-up on recommended optimizations

#### 3. Trend Analysis & Forecasting
- **Performance Trajectory Analysis**: Predict future performance based on current trends
- **Seasonal Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring optimization opportunities
- **ROI Tracking**: Measure business impact of GEO optimizations
- **Strategy Effectiveness Assessment**: Which tactics drive the best results
